# Notes for Regex Engine testing stage

This project gave me a lot of problems because it's not easy to implement. The problem is not well defined by JetBrains and even some solutions have passed the test when they shouldn't have. 

That's why for stage5 is an entire folder, also the previous stages have nothing to do with this stage5 because, due I didn't get pass the stage, I used someone solution and adapted to me `solved.py`. 

Also there is a debuged version `solved_debuged.py` to see how the script progress chopping strings.

**Obviously, for stage6 I started from stage5.**
